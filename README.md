# Card-game-War

Hello! I think I did pretty awesome!  By replicating this War game, I was able to understand OOP and the importance of encapsulation. Definitely makes you appreciate code better. I'm a little bummed that I didnt get it to run completely, but I'm fully confident I'll find the problem and solve. Or someone one else can see my code and figure it out. Either way I'm glad I made it this far!
